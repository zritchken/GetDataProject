## ReadMe file for Coursera Project

    The script (Project.R) takes the following files from the UCI HAR Dataset folder and merges them into one tidy dataset.         There are a total of five steps to achieve this. All .txt files are listed below, and should be in the user's directory:
    features.txt - This file provides descriptions for what the 561 columns in the xtest and xtrain files represent.
    activity_labels.txt - This file provides descriptions of the six different activities.
    subject_test.txt - This file provides the sequence of the 2947 test observations with respect to each observation's subject.
    X_test.txt - This file contains the raw data of the 2947 test observations for 561 observed variables.
    y_test.txt - Thie file provides the sequence of the 2947 test observations with respect to each observaton's activity.
    subject_train.txt - This file provides the sequence of the 7352 train observations with respect to each observation's subject.
    X_train.txt - This file contains the raw data of the 7352 train observations for 561 observed variables.
    y_train.txt - Thie file provides the sequence of the 7352 train observations with respect to each observaton's activity.
